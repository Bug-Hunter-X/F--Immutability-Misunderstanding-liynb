This example demonstrates a common mistake in F# related to immutability.  Beginners often assume that functions modify their inputs, as in mutable languages. This is not the case in F#.  The `addOne` function returns a new value, leaving the original `x` unchanged. The solution shows how to correctly handle this using mutable variables or the `let` keyword for reassignment within a scope.
